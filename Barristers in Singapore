We have represented uniformed personnel, company directors, housewives and even students with their brush with the law. We encourage anyone facing a potential charge or prosecution to come for a personalised and professional consultation so that we are engaged early.
Once instructed, we spare no effort to do the necessary research and groundwork in order to convince the relevant authorities to not charge our clients. On many occasions, with the benefit of our advice and early intervention, our clients have been let off with warnings. If and when our clients are charged, we strive to obtain the minimal penalty by making appropriate representations and pleas.
