we represented a wife whose husband had carefully planned the divorce for years. He had turned the teen children against her and emptied their jointly-owned safe box. As his contribution to the matrimonial home was 90% or more, he wanted a transfer of the matrimonial home with just a refund of her meagre CPF funds. After contested interlocutory applications and trial, we successfully got nearly 40% of all the matrimonial assets for her.
